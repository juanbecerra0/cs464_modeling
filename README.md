# Overview

This is my submission for the CS 464 assignment #2. In this assignment,
we are tasked with creating a simple terrain created using a height field.
Our algorithms creates a 100x100 grid that uses a vertex shader t0 adjust 
the Y values. It is then lit using both a directional light and a ambient 
light. 

# Grid Geometry

The grid geometry (100x100) was created using the code provided during 
a lecture. It's essentially broken down to creating four for-loops that 
generate vertices, normals, texture (s and t) coordinates, and face
face bindings. The Y coordinates were created using random values from
-1.0 to 1.0.
